Acting as an alternate narrative, satirical work broadcasts the otherwise unmentionable.

Also, the room seems to consistently have too few chairs in it, based on the class sizes of the classes scheduled here.  Could more chairs be added (perhaps add a row of chairs at the back, so that there are always enough chairs even when the room overflows).  I\u2019m guessing that the number of chairs reduces because students move chairs to other classrooms in the engineering building which don\u2019t have enough chairs.  Perhaps we can solve this problem by ensuring that all classrooms in the engineering building have more chairs than the size of the maximum class that is scheduled for those rooms.  The registry can probably provide information about the sizes of the classes that have been scheduled in those rooms. Thanks,Ayorkor   -- G.
