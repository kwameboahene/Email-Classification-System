We currently occupy South campus. Changes in plans and infrastructure were discussed. Ashesi\u2019s Programs: Determined needs based on high school students, needs in corporate Ghana, and the interests of the donor-base for particular programs. Needs and interest determined how Ashesi would move forward. Potential graduate programs in law/public policy, engineering, and liberal studies but interests shifted from the latter. Future plans were outlined. Ashesi\u2019s People: Ashesi desired to be more pan-African. First years, the institution focused on gender balance. Additionally, Ashesi wants to lift the non-Ghanaian number of students to 30%, increase student scholarships, deepen the financial aid program, continue to preserve gender balance in the engineering program, and the establish a \u201cbrain-gain\u201d fund or Ghanaians in the diaspora to help them pay off student loans in order to come home and live on the local salary scale. Ashesi\u2019s Spaces: Ashesi recognized the need for an endowment. At present, Ashesi is campus rich and cash poor (i.e., infrastructure and scholarships are present but need an endowment or cash reserve). Plans for fundraising were outlined in detail.  We are happy with the questions that have come through after the panel discussion and looking forward to more. Kindly email your concerns and questions to execforum@ashesi.edu.gh.

The report consists of a summary of activities and the corresponding financials.  With respect to funding and financing school activities, the following new initiatives have been implemented: Introduction of an expense record document: Beginning next semester the expense record document will be distributed to respective clubs and committees to aid them in providing detailed records of every expenditure they incur. Additionally, all committees and clubs are to provide the appropriate source documents (receipts, etc.) to validate the expenses identified. This move is to ensure accountability and accuracy in identifying and recording the expenses. \u2022Creation of a standardized expenditure reporting template: This template was instituted to guide the current and future finance committees regarding how to report particular line items under the appropriate sections. This is in line with the accounting principle of Consistency, where same principles are used in preparing financial statements over a number of periods. This would also facilitate the comparison of statements, thus resolving the issue where items were charged to different accounts in different administrations.\u2022ASC Funding Policy: Following the creation of a standardized budget template, the committee is creating an ASC Funding Policy document. This document would provides a list of items that won't be funded using ASC funds, and also contains guidelines for clubs and committees in preparing budgets.

The appeal sought to either confirm the initial verdict and sanctions, confirm the initial verdict but reduce the sanctions or dismiss the initial verdict and sanctions. The AJC established that the male student repeatedly groped and touched a female student without her consent. The male student ignored verbal and physical communications to indicate that his advances were inappropriate and unacceptable.

Those who do will be subject to serious sanctions, which may include adjudication by the AJC or suspension by the Executive Committee, as described under the Campus Safety decision (Section 10.2).

The D:Lab is collaborating with Design Thinkers Group, Netherlands, and HPI d-school at the University of Cape Town (UCT), South Africa to present the second Design Thinking Ghana Conference (DTGC 2018), starting on June 20th. The other organizers include the Ghana Design Network and the Design Thinking Ghana Hub.   This year, the DTGC will focus its case studies, workshops and panels on using design thinking to gain competitive advantage and to realize social impact. The organizers believe that when a company has deep customer or user insights, it can understand customers\u2019 needs better than its competitors and subsequently provide the best solution. If customers enjoy the best solution, their level of satisfaction will sustain the company\u2019s business and also ensure the greatest impact. The presentations therefore show how companies have used design thinking to create new offerings for products, services and programs in healthcare, telecoms, financial services, customer service, education, energy, informal sector concepts, community development among others. The program activities will be led by keynote speakers Arne Van Oosterom from the Netherlands and Dr Rael Futerman of the d-school at UCT, South Africa. They are supported by speakers from all over the country and Nigeria with representation from Ashesi\u2019s current and former faculty and faculty interns, Dr. Gordon Adomdza, David Hutchful, Dela Kumahor (Program Chair), Carl Agbenyega and Philip Asare. Dr Rael Futerman, will take participants through an action-based Design Thinking workshop on June 20 & 21. Register www.bit.ly/DTGC2018dschWorkshop. This workshop will introduce participants to Design Thinking tools, methods and mindsets. The UCT chapter of the d-school is the newest and third Hasso Plattner Institute of Design Thinking in the world, joining the well-established d-schools at Stanford and Potsdam Universities. The D:Lab is therefore excited about opportunities to develop programs together.The D:Lab is offering 10 promo codes for 25% off the conference registration fee for the various categories listed.

Akornor will therefore be mostly operating out of the student center from Monday, November 5th, and we will all be eating there as well. We have made the following temporary arrangements to accommodate Akornor\u2019s operations during this transition period: 1. As we have not yet connected the student center to our internet systems, Akornor\u2019s payment point will remain where it currently is at the Databank Hall (by Databank Lecture Hall 218). 2.

Hydroponics may not account for all of it, but certainly one of them!   What is Hydroponics and Why does it deserve any attention?In case you are not acquainted with the technology, Hydroponics is simply a method of growing crops using nutrient solutions instead of growing the crops in soil. This technique makes it possible to provide crops with the best amount of nutrients to optimize crop growth and yield.   The Hydroponic Farming Technique boasts of faster crop growth and is environmentally friendly because it uses less water than conventional agriculture. The technique, if adopted in Ghana, will be crucial to sustaining the vegetation as hydroponic farming eliminates the need to cut down trees and destruction natural habitats. This semester the Ashesi D:Lab Hydroponics team, under the Farm Modeling Project, is working to bring this wonder to Ashesi. The team is currently working to employ and test the hydroponic technology under our harsh weather conditions. The project will capture learnings and experiences that will start and contribute to the conversations on sustainable farming method and hydroponic farming in Ghana and beyond.   Work has already started on the structure, IoT, and will continue after the mid semester break. We welcome interest, suggestions and support in any form from the community!

Host families will be solicited from families of Ashesi Ghanaian students, faculty and staff, the Ashesi alumni community as well as friends of Ashesi.

His recent research has delved into such issues as the role of education as a buffer against unemployment, the effect of business cycles on poverty rates, racial diversity in economics and the distribution of income between labor and capital.Years before current debates on whether raising interest rates would stifle labor markets, Jefferson created a straightforward model to analyze the quandary. Anticipating today\u2019s discussions of declining labor share by nearly a decade, he confirmed the trend\u2019s reality. He\u2019s also explored arcane matters involving seigniorage payments, transformation parameters, and monetary neutrality. Each study is characterized by clear questions, careful technique, consideration of alternative definitions and explanations, and strong but qualified conclusions.Jefferson, whose research has been funded by the National Science Foundation and who served as president of the National Economic Association in 2005, can also provide expert commentary on the Federal Reserve and the monetary policy making process.", "Class": "2"}, {"From": "Wayne Gakuo <wayne.gakuo@aucampus.onmicrosoft.com>", "Subject": "What to look out for in the D:Lab This Week", "Message": "Ashesi D:Lab Content Series: Season 1, Episode 3A.

A helpful website hosted by the ICELP is available: https://www.icpel.org/soka.html. The format of the conference of \"Educators without Borders\" at Soka is as a series of discussion groups in which participants from around the world share experiences and plans and seek comment and collaboration.  The mission of \"Educators without Borders,\" according to its website: \"Our mission is the establishment of a global network of educational scholars who have chosen to work on behalf of all children going to school. Our main objective is all children have a right to go to school. Our second objective is not to make schools as they exist more efficient at what they do, but to call into question what schools do in the first place and how they work or should work to provide greater equality to all children and their families. It is not only the availability of schools for all children worldwide, but what kind of schooling is available to them. Educational leaders must become emboldened to step out of the school/state nexus so that we can become true educational leaders without borders. We stand against misogyny, xenophobia, nativism, racism, and all the 'isms' in which human beings are denied equal and just value for living a life in happiness.\" If you are interested or have questions, please contact James Spady at jspady@soka.edu.

Tickets will be sold at the door at GHc40 each. Here is the some info on what it's all about:  There is no escaping art.  It surrounds us: in everything from the fabrics we wear to the labels adorning what we drink.  Black people have long created and revered art. Yet, from music to visual arts to product design, the gift to create art is one of the least valued in Africa and throughout her diaspora. As a result, our people have rarely successfully built wealth that we could hand down from generation to generation by pursuing our art.  Hidden in a walkthrough maze with new experiences at every turn, One Night Stand will be a uniquely experiential celebration of black art in its many forms.  Attendees will have multidimensional experiences of the art on display and dive into sonic interpretations that bring each piece alive through combinations of sight and sound.  How do we invest in, develop and spread our art across a world that has always been eager to dance to our music or take inspiration from our fashion? How do we invest in sustainable creative industries that serve our own interests? These are the questions One Night Stand hopes to articulate and engage with.  The exhibition will be followed by a in-depth conversation on the experiences of the artwork, the future of Ghana\u2019s creative scene and the way forward in creating generational wealth for our collective benefit.

In typical Ashesi style, I encourage all departments that participated in running the logistics for this event to do a postpartum review of what went well and what we could do better, so that in subsequent years we will see a more fluid ceremony, come rain or shine.

Just make sure not to nap too close to bedtime or for too long, and a nap will do your body good.Don't work in bed. Working in bed can make getting to sleep harder. Keep your work space separate from your sleep space to keep insomnia at bay.Get a full night's rest whenever possible. While the amount of sleep each person needs varies, most people need 7-9 hours to feel fully rested. While this may not be possible every night, try to sleep a full night whenever you get the chance.Stick to a schedule. With different classes and work hours each day, it can be hard to stick to a schedule, but keeping sleep times similar from day to day can greatly improve your chances of getting a good night's sleep.Understand that lack of sleep can have a big impact. Lack of sleep doesn't just make you cranky, it can also reduce your ability to concentrate and to excel at class, so try to get as much sleep as you need.Work out bedtimes with roommates. When sharing a room with someone it can be hard to go to bed when you need to and not get woken up when you don't want to. Try to work with your roomies to make sure you each get the sleep you need.Make time to come and visit all our vendors and enjoy the Wellness VibeENJOY YOUR BREAK", "Class": "2"}, {"From": "Aba Kaadze Enyimayew <aenyimayew@ashesi.edu.gh>", "Subject": "Our Christmas on the Hill Performance", "Message": "Dear All,An idea has been given for our performance for Christmas on the Hill scheduled for 6th December, 2018.
