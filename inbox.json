The mission of the fund is to support educational achievement for the children of Berekuso towards a brighter future for the community. The fund is guided by the vision of Berekuso as a centre of excellence for education and purposeful development. And as an organization, we aim to model the values of commitment & hard work, impartiality, accountability & transparency, and to be innovative & action driven. Since the founding of the fund in December 2016 by Nana Oteng Korankye II, we have raised close to 100,000 GHS and have begun a scholarship program for high performing BECE candidates from area basic schools. The fund is currently supporting 11 students in their first year of secondary school. The purpose of the stakeholder and fundraising event on May 19th is to report to stakeholders our progress and initiatives thus far and to raise funds to secure the scholarship program, run a summer program to give academic support to students from Berekuso attending high school and struggling with math and literacy, and to pursue partnerships that bring a vocational high school to the area. We view the Ashesi University community as our most important stakeholders! Please see attached invitation.

We currently occupy South campus. Changes in plans and infrastructure were discussed. Ashesi\u2019s Programs: Determined needs based on high school students, needs in corporate Ghana, and the interests of the donor-base for particular programs. Needs and interest determined how Ashesi would move forward. Potential graduate programs in law/public policy, engineering, and liberal studies but interests shifted from the latter. Future plans were outlined. Ashesi\u2019s People: Ashesi desired to be more pan-African. First years, the institution focused on gender balance. Additionally, Ashesi wants to lift the non-Ghanaian number of students to 30%, increase student scholarships, deepen the financial aid program, continue to preserve gender balance in the engineering program, and the establish a \u201cbrain-gain\u201d fund or Ghanaians in the diaspora to help them pay off student loans in order to come home and live on the local salary scale. Ashesi\u2019s Spaces: Ashesi recognized the need for an endowment. At present, Ashesi is campus rich and cash poor (i.e., infrastructure and scholarships are present but need an endowment or cash reserve). Plans for fundraising were outlined in detail.  We are happy with the questions that have come through after the panel discussion and looking forward to more. Kindly email your concerns and questions to execforum@ashesi.edu.gh. These will be answered and reviewed towards moving Ashesi forward. Regards,Aba K.

The report consists of a summary of activities and the corresponding financials.  With respect to funding and financing school activities, the following new initiatives have been implemented: Introduction of an expense record document: Beginning next semester the expense record document will be distributed to respective clubs and committees to aid them in providing detailed records of every expenditure they incur. Additionally, all committees and clubs are to provide the appropriate source documents (receipts, etc.) to validate the expenses identified. This move is to ensure accountability and accuracy in identifying and recording the expenses. \u2022Creation of a standardized expenditure reporting template: This template was instituted to guide the current and future finance committees regarding how to report particular line items under the appropriate sections. This is in line with the accounting principle of Consistency, where same principles are used in preparing financial statements over a number of periods. This would also facilitate the comparison of statements, thus resolving the issue where items were charged to different accounts in different administrations.\u2022ASC Funding Policy: Following the creation of a standardized budget template, the committee is creating an ASC Funding Policy document. This document would provides a list of items that won't be funded using ASC funds, and also contains guidelines for clubs and committees in preparing budgets. It also gives an overview of low priority items the Committee considers when allocating funds. \u2022 If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us on this email. We would like to thank you for a fantastic semester and looking forward to the next.

Professor Wangari Maathai was born in Nyeri, in Kenya, in 1940. She obtained a degree in Biological Sciences in 1964, a Master of Science degree in 1966, before obtaining a Ph.D. in 1971. The first woman in East and Central Africa to earn a doctorate degree, Professor Maathai became Chair of the Department of Veterinary Anatomy and an Associate Professor in 1976 and 1977 respectively. In both cases, she was the first woman to attain those positions in the region. She received 15 Honourary Doctorates over her lifetime, and was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2004 for her contribution to sustainable development, democracy and peace. You can read her full bio here. As a keen ambassador for peace, environmental protection and the empowerment of women, Professor Wangari Maathai represents many of the ideals Ashesi stands for, and I believe she serves as a powerful role model for all of us.

Yesterday, he called to tell me he needed the receipt of the fees payment I made for the first semester. It was not convenient to go to Tema where I was living  last year to fetch the receipt but I had to and this morning, I sent him a soft copy of the receipt.  He has just called to request the forms I filled for the meal plan in August. I do not have those documents at the moment but can confirm that this semester I paid one thousand five hundred cedis for meals alone since he informed that there was a balance from last semester but he didn't know exactly how much. We have had to move houses and it will take a while to find my copy of the documents but in paying the fees last semester, I sent your school all the scanned copies of the documents for everything including the meal plan so your institution has copies as well which you may kindly refer to.  It was my understanding as per discussions we had that the meal plan was computerized and deductions are made depending on the students' consumption so I didn't anticipate any problems except, of course, in instances where they was no money to support the student. Has my son exhausted the amount paid for the first semester and this second semester as well? If no, why is he unable to access his meals? Kindly respond at your earliest convenience so that I will know what to do. How much do I have to pay till the end of the semester so that there will be no interruptions of his supply of meal? When you give me the amount, kindly inform me of the account number to pay the difference into. Thank you in anticipation of a quich a response to remedy the situation.

I will like to bring to your attention the careless driving of Ken, CTK-Kitase-Ashesi, 7:00am bus. Over the period I have been on his bus, his driving has been careless and reckless. I do not know how best this can be communicated to him as a number of passengers have tried to make him understand his driving endangers our lives. This morning, his driving was extremely careless. He overtook three cars in a row not minding the bad nature of the road and the effect the movement of the bus has on the passengers (he was speeding in this case. It felt like there was someone who needed medical attention on the bus. Which was not the case. We are just coming to work). He kept speeding and only \u201cslows down\u201d (sudden brakes which jerks almost everyone on the bus) to get over the makeshift ramps on the road. On the Adenta- Oyarifa road he kept speeding and you could feel the bus swaying at a point. At the junction leading to the lane to Ashesi, he almost run into a pickup and the pickup driver brought his arm out making signs which indicated he wanted to know where he was speeding to. My second concern is with the bus. What is the effect of this careless and reckless driving on a rough, untarred road having on the bus? As he speeds and hits just any pothole isn\u2019t he weakening the bus? My third concern is, he is always driving this careless and reckless and it is really bad and I feel every passenger who sits in the bus is being endangered to a point. We might not report any incidence for now and maybe that is why he continues with his \u201cbad driving\u201d. He needs to be spoken to so he could drive better. Finally, I will like to know if there is any way we can evaluate his driving as well as the driving of all the drivers since we patronize their services. Thank you and have a good day.

The D:Lab is collaborating with Design Thinkers Group, Netherlands, and HPI d-school at the University of Cape Town (UCT), South Africa to present the second Design Thinking Ghana Conference (DTGC 2018), starting on June 20th. The other organizers include the Ghana Design Network and the Design Thinking Ghana Hub.   This year, the DTGC will focus its case studies, workshops and panels on using design thinking to gain competitive advantage and to realize social impact. The organizers believe that when a company has deep customer or user insights, it can understand customers\u2019 needs better than its competitors and subsequently provide the best solution. If customers enjoy the best solution, their level of satisfaction will sustain the company\u2019s business and also ensure the greatest impact. The presentations therefore show how companies have used design thinking to create new offerings for products, services and programs in healthcare, telecoms, financial services, customer service, education, energy, informal sector concepts, community development among others. The program activities will be led by keynote speakers Arne Van Oosterom from the Netherlands and Dr Rael Futerman of the d-school at UCT, South Africa. They are supported by speakers from all over the country and Nigeria with representation from Ashesi\u2019s current and former faculty and faculty interns, Dr. Gordon Adomdza, David Hutchful, Dela Kumahor (Program Chair), Carl Agbenyega and Philip Asare. Dr Rael Futerman, will take participants through an action-based Design Thinking workshop on June 20 & 21. Register www.bit.ly/DTGC2018dschWorkshop. This workshop will introduce participants to Design Thinking tools, methods and mindsets. The UCT chapter of the d-school is the newest and third Hasso Plattner Institute of Design Thinking in the world, joining the well-established d-schools at Stanford and Potsdam Universities. The D:Lab is therefore excited about opportunities to develop programs together.The D:Lab is offering 10 promo codes for 25% off the conference registration fee for the various categories listed. The code is AshesiD:Lab@25%  Register at www.bit.ly/DTGC2018Register   Don\u2019t miss out on the June 22 sessions (and perhaps the June 23 sessions after the historic Ashesi graduation ceremony) .

What is DSC?The Developer Student Clubs (DSC) program is a grassroots channel through which we provide mobile and web development skills for students, towards employability. In addition to workshops, we also provide an opportunity for students to apply their newly gained skills to develop solutions for local businesses, and then provide visibility via showcases. Target AudienceDSC activities are targeted towards students (primarily University students of all programs and any others including faculty members) who want to learn development [native app & mobile web] skills. As part of the learning experience for students, we can work with local stakeholders who may include local businesses or NGOs or other organizations. Students are encouraged to be part of DSC regardless of their majors or programming knowledge. Why DSC?\u00b7         Students have the opportunity to not only learn development skills, but also apply it for live problems by developing solutions, and then showcasing their work within their communities.Students get to develop their portfolios by showcasing the projects that have live applications rather than academic-only projects.\u2022By developing solutions for local businesses/organizations, the college is positioning itself as a center of talented individuals that can provide offerings to the local community.\u2022 "}, {"From": "Abigail L Welbeck <awelbeck@ashesi.edu.gh>", "Subject": "Students Mailing List", "Message": ""}, {"From": "Kenobi Morris <kmorris@aucampus.onmicrosoft.com>", "Subject": "Projector at FAB103", "Message": "Hi, Would it be possible to have a temporary projector stationed at FAB103 pending a complete installation of the classroom fittings?

Did you know that Cameroon was formerly two different countries, Southern Cameroon and La Republique du Cameroun?  Do you remember that last year Yahya Jammeh of The Gambia was only forced out of power through an opposition coalition after 22 year in power? Did you know Jammeh left a debt of a staggering 120% of GDP to incoming President Barrow?  Ashesi students are indeed the future African leaders and we know you\u2019d love to know much more. Therefore, we are excited to invite you to a panel discussion on the current state of The Gambia (post-election) in the absence of Yahya Jammeh, and the state of Cameroon after Paul Biya's term is extended to 2025, giving him the chance to clock 43 years in power, amid current war in Southern Cameroon.  The panel discussion will be held on  Tuesday, 6 November in LH216 at 4:40 pm.

I wish to raise a genuine concern regarding the new students management system, Camu.       Formerly, focus had a feature that allowed lecturers to upload grades as the semester rolled on. This feature also allowed students to view their grades in all courses enrolled for the semester.  For instance, if students wrote a quiz in a particular course, the lecturer or faculty intern would upload the grade for that quiz and any subsequent quizzes, assignments, mid-semester exam and project.      This feature was very beneficial to students because it helped us monitor our performance from the beginning of the semester till the end. It also helped us to know which courses we are performing well in, and which ones needed more attention. However, Camu does not have this feature and hence does not allow both lecturers and students to monitor performance as mentioned earlier.

Here\u2019s an opportunity to try out those fun farming activities you\u2019ve been wanting to try out. It is also an opportunity to develop a new interest, bond, interact with different cultures, and just get a little dirty. Exhibitions of the different vegetables at Tuungane will be done all through the day. Be sure to pass by the student hangout space to learn more. At 4.20 pm, we\u2019ll be heading down to the farm!!! On our way there, watch out for possible prizes to be won. P.S. Ensure you are in your most comfortable shoes! Sincerely, Tuungane Cosmospolitan Gardening.

As part of the project, we will be clearing the lot in-front of the center and moving all current structures from that area, including the temporary kitchen in which Akornor\u2019s team has been cooking. In anticipation of this, we are excited to report that construction on the kitchen and some eating areas in the student center were sped up and these spaces are now ready for use. Akornor will therefore be mostly operating out of the student center from Monday, November 5th, and we will all be eating there as well. We have made the following temporary arrangements to accommodate Akornor\u2019s operations during this transition period: 1. As we have not yet connected the student center to our internet systems, Akornor\u2019s payment point will remain where it currently is at the Databank Hall (by Databank Lecture Hall 218). 2. Once payment is made, we will have to take our coupon to the student center to be served.  This will last only for a short period, while the student center is being completed and brought online. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and ask for your support to make this transition successful. If you have any questions, do reach out to Casper, Dzifa or myself.

If at any time you have a question about the contents of this email or want to send a suggestion, please feel free to email me at karhin@ashesi.edu.gh. Writing Centre Coordinator IntroductionMy name is Kaneisha Gaston Arhin. I am coming from the US to work at Ashesi. Although I am not new to Ghana, this will be my first time living and working in this country. I come to you all with experiences in writing studies, first-year composition, and literary studies. Please feel free to email me at any time at karhin@ashesi.edu.gh. Writing Centre InformationThe Ashesi Writing Centre aims to serve the Ashesi Community by promoting both print and digital composition as a way of learning, communicating, and thinking clearly for multiple audiences through collaborative learning experiences. We at the Centre support individual writing goals and discuss ways of developing the composition skills of those that we consult. Through workshops, group consultations, and one-on-one consultations, we encourage students to use their unique thought processes as they compose, develop their unique voices and become more critical communicators. We hope that we cultivate a space where all members celebrate the diversity of language and prepare students to operate in an array of multi-lingual, multi-literate, and multi-modal environments. Faculty, students and volunteers who are passionate about composition and language staff the Writing Centre. In short, the Writing Centre is not a place where students should come to \u201cfix\u201d their writing. Instead, we aim to develop their critical thinking skills about how to produce clear writing for multiple purposes and audiences. Writing for us is not limited to papers and essays. It can include any form of composition, both print and digital, for any assignment in or out of class."}, {"From": "Ashesi Support Centre <supportcentre@ashesi.edu.gh>", "Subject": "Two Factor Authentication", "Message": "The Two Factor Authentication process has been initialized.

It\u2019s an interesting question worth pondering. Another question: Even if we decide that imperfection is not necessarily the epitome of beauty, could we at least not consider the imperfect as \u201chorrible\u201d or something to be hidden? In Ashesi\u2019s early days, our founding team was forced by circumstance to get comfortable with having some imperfections, while simultaneously projecting the beauty that lay within our institution. I also remember our decision to choose a hand-drawn logo, with its asymmetry and imperfections, because it truly looked more beautiful to us than the perfectly symmetrical, computer-generated alternative. We thought it captured the spirit and the beauty of Adinkra in a way that a computer drawn image did not. Reading this article brings back memories of those days. Enjoy.

Somewhere between 2008 and 2011, I used my diana.osei@ashesi.edu.gh address to open a dropbox account which served me quite well while I was in school. Recently, I tried logging back into this dropbox account only to realize that I have forgotten my password.  I contacted dropbox support team for assistance and they asked me to login to diana.osei@ashesi.edu.gh and click on the password reset link that has been sent there. I explained that I no longer have access to that e-mail account and their response was that they can do nothing to help if I cannot login to diana.osei@ashesi.edu.gh.  I am therefore writing to Ashesi IT Department to give me temporal access to my diana.osei@ashesi.edu.gh so that I can quickly login and click the password reset link to regain access to my precious dropbox account. After I am able to login to my dropbox account, I will backup all my dropbox files and close the dropbox account to avoid future inconveniences.  I hope you can assist me most urgently.

Twice a week, on Wednesdays and Fridays at 5.10pm, and sometimes in between, we train on the basketball court in the student's hostel , opposite the Bliss Student Lounge. Additionally, we are coached by the no-nonsense Nana Ama Bortsie-Ansah.

My thoughts:Although we may not fall in the category of some of the extreme examples. I hope we will be more mindful, kind, civil, warm and really enjoy working with each other and with our students rather than defer to actions and behaviors that will bring each other down. Recognizing that some of these actions may not be intentional, I encourage all of us to check ourselves when we recognize we are going out of order, be quick to apologize and not be defensive and together strive to make this place what we want it to be. Always remember that our actions speak louder than our words. We model the behaviors around us so let's be a good example to each other and the good bug of civility, kindness, and integrity will catch on. https://www.ted.com/talks/christine_porath_why_being_nice_to_your_coworkers_is_good_for_businessWhy being respectful to your coworkers is good for businesswww.ted.comLooking to get ahead in your career?

The rooms also do not have ironing boards and some students are now ironing on their beds which is very bad as it could damage the bed or lead to other damages. I have advised them to rather use the learning table whilst we wait to receive the ironing boards.3.  And also, the drying line at Block C does not have ropes attached to the erected poles. This is making it difficult for students to dry their clothing\u2019s  and towels.4.  Also, there are no notice boards at Block C.5.

In the spirit of exploring different results for our campus climate, the ODIP is rolling out three major programs which have been thoughtfully put together to help address some of the challenges we have been struggling with as a community. The Host Family ProgramThe Host Family Program is designed to fulfill a twofold objective: i) give international students at Ashesi the opportunity to expand their Ghanaian network throughout their stay in Ghana by offering them a home away from home and ii) grant Ghanaian families who sign up the opportunity to learn about different countries and cultures through the international students they host. Host families will be solicited from families of Ashesi Ghanaian students, faculty and staff, the Ashesi alumni community as well as friends of Ashesi. Watch out for the program launch and more details from our lead Rosemary Kotei Buckman. Also, feel free to email her @rkotei@ashesi.edu.gh or go and have a chat with her at the ODIP to know more.

I asked if the apartment was o.k. He reported:There is a gas smell in the apartment. Some background: Steve and I lived there for 3 years, and we also had a gas smell. Also we would go through gas containers way too quickly. We changed the regulator (many times), at one point facilities came and dug up the whole gas line but never found a leak. We used to just shut the gas off at the container when we weren\u2019t using it, which solved the problem. I have told him to do the same in the meantime. I guess by process of elimination the problem might be the stove (actually we replaced the stove\u2026) or the connector to the stove\u2026? Anyway, FYI.\u2022The ceiling fan in the living room doesn\u2019t work. He said he doesn\u2019t mind it, so maybe you can add that to be fixed after he vacates.\u2022Best wishes,Suzanne Suzanne F.

I have already registered through the web portal link that was sent and it was successful; I am able to sign in with no issues using the web portal. First of all, I want to know if the CAMU app on the \u2018Apple Store\u2019 is the ideal app to download. I ask this because in the student manual that was sent to us, you instructed us to download from the Google Play Store. However, I went ahead to check if the app was available on the Apple Store. Fortunately, I found the application on the Apple Store, downloaded it and tried to sign in to it but despite the fact that I used the same password as I did when I used the web portal, I was told my email/password was wrong. I double checked my credentials and everything was right. Thus I am not too sure what the issue is here and would love to get some clarifications. Secondly, I want to know how I can edit my profile information through the web portal. I cannot seem to find a way to do so. When I signed in initially, I was met with a wrong date of birth (11th July, 1997) but my actual date of birth is the 7th of June, 1997. Also, the student manual that was sent implied that I can only edit through the mobile app, which seems not to be working for me. I would love to edit my profile and add a picture and the correct date of birth. I would be grateful if you could help me answer these questions and help me solve my issues.

Prof. Jefferson will present on the topic \u201cGlobal Poverty in Historical Perspective\u201d, and will draw from his new book Poverty: A Short Introduction. This AELS is scheduled for:Date: Wednesday, 17th October 2018In: Nana Araba Apt hall (LH 216)From: 3:00pm \u2013 4:30pm (Faculty Free Time) See below a bio of Prof. JeffersonPhilip Jefferson is a former research economist at the Federal Reserve Board of the USA and currently teaches Macroeconomics and Econometrics at Swarthmore College in the USA (the alma matter of both Patrick Awuah and Stephen Armah).At Swarthmore, apart from conducting research, Prof Jefferson teaches courses in econometrics, macroeconomics, inequality, and poverty. His recent research has delved into such issues as the role of education as a buffer against unemployment, the effect of business cycles on poverty rates, racial diversity in economics and the distribution of income between labor and capital.Years before current debates on whether raising interest rates would stifle labor markets, Jefferson created a straightforward model to analyze the quandary. Anticipating today\u2019s discussions of declining labor share by nearly a decade, he confirmed the trend\u2019s reality. He\u2019s also explored arcane matters involving seigniorage payments, transformation parameters, and monetary neutrality. Each study is characterized by clear questions, careful technique, consideration of alternative definitions and explanations, and strong but qualified conclusions.Jefferson, whose research has been funded by the National Science Foundation and who served as president of the National Economic Association in 2005, can also provide expert commentary on the Federal Reserve and the monetary policy making process."}, {"From": "Emmanuel Ntow <emmanuel.ntow@ashesi.edu.gh>", "Subject": "Paper Cut credit", "Message": "Hi, Please load some credits for me to be able to photocopy.

This has been effective since January 2008 and has seen 12 classes sign unto it. To commemorate its 10th anniversary, the ASC Judicial and Electoral Council(JEC) decided to evaluate its effectiveness from the view point of students signed unto the Academic Honor Code by administering a survey, themed \u201cLoud It!\u201d. 204 students, representing 34.99% of continuing students, participated in the survey. The main highlights of the results showed that:87.8% of participants believed the Honor Code for Examinations was very effective however it is ineffective to an extent because it is limited to the classroom and does not tackle social issues\u202270.6% of participants also thought Ashesi should enact a \u201cSocial Honor Code\u201d to extend the honor system outside the classroom.\u2022Findings from the survey do indicate that the progress that has been made with the Academic Honor Code is laudable, and has set the foundation for a community of trust to be built further outside the classroom. Just as students and the Ashesi Community in 2008 took a step to come up with the Academic Honor Code, we also can take a step forward to expand the current honor system if we deem it fit. Look out for engagements and interactions with the JEC to discuss the honor system and the way forward. Kindly find attached a full report on the survey containing further details of responses from the survey. Kudos Ashesi!

The winner of the intra-campus event qualifies to compete in one of fifteen regional finals in selected cities worldwide. The winning team from each host city will progress to the accelerator stage where they build their network through mentorship, participate in advisory and strategic planning sessions as they create prototypes. Ultimately, the global finals allow your team to stand a chance of winning $1,000,000 in start-up capital for the business idea generated, whilst changing the world.This year\u2019s theme is centered on youth unemployment, as Hult prize continually seeks to tackle issues surrounding the United Nations Sustainable Development goals. A grounded business idea is NOT required to participate in the Hult Prize, as the objective is to build the next big start-up, not necessarily to identify it.Can you build the foundations of a venture that will provide meaningful work for 10,000 youth within the next decade?Did I hear a yes?

To make these projects relevant, we will like to have real clients with real needs that we will serve. So for example, looking at all the new buildings being commissioned on campus, a team of students could aid with some aspect of infrastructural deployments ongoing, or could for example aid the Office of Community Engagement undertake a community engagement project to achieve a specific outcome or could help the HR office plan and deploy some system or event etc. It could be a private project you have not been able to get started (for example, we have a client who needs a hydroponics system prototyped for them).The projects will be initiated next week and will close in the first week of December. Student teams will scope the projects and phase the scope out if it is too large for them to be able to complete within the period, in consultation with the client. We are by this email soliciting projects either on or off campus, that students can work on with you. We need some of them to have engineering components: mechanical or electrical or IT/ AI/ Machine related, for our engineering majors. If it does not have an engineering component, students within the relevant major will pick it up. So please throw anything you have in mind or are working on at us, and we will work with you to see if it will be a good fit for the class. Please reach out by return mail to Johnathan and I (please be careful not to reply all unless you need to) by COB Tuesday September 4th.We will come by your office at your convenience to discuss what is possible and help you develop a requirements brief that the students can use.

The main highlights of the results showed that:87.8% of participants believed the Honor Code for Examinations was very effective however it is ineffective to an extent because it is limited to the classroom and does not tackle social issues\u202270.6% of participants also thought Ashesi should enact a \u201cSocial Honor Code\u201d to extend the honor system outside the classroom. \u2022Based on the output of this survey, the JEC took the initiative to come up with a Social Honor Code that will extend the honor system outside the classroom. Below is the proposed Social Honor Code pledge: \"As a member of the Ashesi Community, I will act with honesty, integrity and respect for others, and will hold my peers accountable to abide by these principles and by the university\u2019s code of conduct.\" The ASC Parliament will engage the student body by having conversations and discussions about this code.

The Faculty of Arts & Sciences will be renamed to the Faculty of Arts & Social Sciences.1. Decouple the Humanities and Social Sciences Department from the Business Administration Department and have the two separate departments be part of the Faculty of Arts & Social Sciences.2. Rename the Faculty of Engineering to the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science.3. Expand the CS department into Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, which will have primary responsibility for overseeing and advising both CS and MIS students.4. Merge Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering and Electrical & Electronic Engineering into one Department of Engineering.5. Bring mathematics and statistics faculty into the CSIS departments. The math and statistics faculty will continue to run courses for all students, including engineering, computer science, MIS, and business administration students. We will create a new Math and Statistics Faculty Coordinator role to help organize this work. Engineering faculty who also teach math will remain in the Engineering department.6.  We also plan to create two new departments reporting the Provost. We will provide more details as we make progress: Department of Research Advancement: This department will be tasked with supporting faculty research, helping coordinate the acquisition of research grants to support scholarly research, and research grant reporting.1. Department of Accreditation and Academic Quality Assurance: This department will work in collaboration with the deans and the heads of academic departments to ensure quality and accreditation compliance.2.

I wanted to pass on this conference opportunity hosted at a rising liberal arts colleges in the U.S.: Soka University of America. The Educators without Borders conference will take place July 13-14 2019, closely followed by and in coordination with the International Council of Education Leadership Professors (ICELP)  meeting in LA July 15-16, 2019. A helpful website hosted by the ICELP is available: https://www.icpel.org/soka.html. The format of the conference of \"Educators without Borders\" at Soka is as a series of discussion groups in which participants from around the world share experiences and plans and seek comment and collaboration.  The mission of \"Educators without Borders,\" according to its website: \"Our mission is the establishment of a global network of educational scholars who have chosen to work on behalf of all children going to school. Our main objective is all children have a right to go to school. Our second objective is not to make schools as they exist more efficient at what they do, but to call into question what schools do in the first place and how they work or should work to provide greater equality to all children and their families. It is not only the availability of schools for all children worldwide, but what kind of schooling is available to them. Educational leaders must become emboldened to step out of the school/state nexus so that we can become true educational leaders without borders. We stand against misogyny, xenophobia, nativism, racism, and all the 'isms' in which human beings are denied equal and just value for living a life in happiness.\" If you are interested or have questions, please contact James Spady at jspady@soka.edu.

The file upload size is rather limited. Please consider raising significantly.\u2022It is not possible to download all assignments for ALL students in one step\u2022When one student submits multiple files (e.g. because of the small upload file size limitation), it is not possible to download all files for one student in one go.\u2022Student names in assignment submissions are not sorted alphabetically, neither by first nor last name. It can be challenging to find submissions from particular student. Is it sorted by index numbers? We tend not to work with index numbers at all because they are not sequential.\u2022When selecting a cohort/section of a class,  one has to scroll through all course combinations, and the probability of choosing incorrectly is really high.

In that regard, we strive to ensure that all our community members (students, staff, and faculty) are enabled and supported to be the best versions of themselves regardless of their disabilities, backgrounds, and experiences which forms their identities.  As such, I strongly encourage you to strive to create a supportive learning community and an environment free of labeling, name-calling, teasing and making fun of people's disabilities, tagging, actions that draw negative attention to any groups of persons, especially those with any form(s) of disability (ies). Instead, let us strive to create a healthy sense of belonging for all.  Always remember our students can and will model the best examples we give and show them, so, lets model and show them the very best. If they see us isolating, they will isolate their colleagues, if they see us being empathetic and inclusive, they will see how to be empathetic and inclusive, if they see us exhibiting a zero-tolerance for ridiculing, name-calling and teasing, they will not entertain such actions and behaviors (or at least know we don't condone it),  if they see us not taking immediate action to call out those instances where negative examples are knowingly or unknowingly exhibited they will believe it's okay and will do same. What we show them is what they will likely do. So we should go beyond the saying and actually demonstrate these positive examples and behaviors each time we engage them in and out of the classroom. Always remember the ODIP is available to support your diversity and inclusion needs as you do this important work of equipping our students with these life-skills. Come and talk to me or any of our responsible officers anytime you need support.

McCarthy will run our regular schedule from Christ the King (CTK) through Kitase to Ashesi at 7:00am.  \u2022Kenneth on the other hand, will begin his trip from Atomic junction at 7:25am; Riis Junction at 7.30am; Adenta Police Station at 7.35am; Pantang Shell at 7.40am and Oyarifa at 7.45am, through the same stretch to Kitase and finally at Ashesi.\u2022 We encourage as many people who live in that part of town to join Ken\u2019s bus to help even out the numbers fairly on these buses. The morning schedule for KFC- Haatso- Atomic Roundabout-Aboum remains the same as its being run currently.

This must change!

Dramatization, drumming/dancing, poetry, skits, choreography, etc are the best ways to score high points with the judges.4. Try to know your team mates and get to know their strengths.

More nursery beds in the farm will be prepared for the next planting of new crops. You want to see how the green and leafy crops look like right now? Pass by the Tuungane Farm and see the far the team has gone to ensure that this is a success!Vertical Farming2.

Last year (2016/2017 academic year), an anonymous survey found that we had an unacceptable rate of sexual misconduct among students. 10.1 percent of respondents indicated that they had experienced some form of sexual misconduct, and one student reported being raped. Led by the Office of Student & Community Affairs, we stepped up conversations about making Ashesi a zero-tolerance space for sexual misconduct and other forms of harassment, and we adjudicated reported cases of sexual misconduct, resulting in two expulsions and one suspension. Moving forward, we also decided to measure the level of sexual misconduct annually. We conducted another survey towards the end of the 2017/2018 academic year (April 2018), in order to determine incidents of sexual misconduct since our last report was published, and to see whether we are making progress. Fifty percent of students responded to the survey. For those who did, thank you for taking the time to help us measure the situation. 4.1 percent of respondents in our most recent survey indicated having been victims of sexual misconduct within our community.  Though we appear to have made progress compared to the previous year, this is still 4.1 percent too many. We must actively work towards ensuring that this is a community that thrives on healthy relationships, where no student here experiences sexual misconduct, and where those who make this community unsafe for others are sanctioned appropriately. There are three important things from this year\u2019s report that should give us all cause to take this seriously: First, seven respondents indicated having experienced rape. Four of these cases involved first year students, prior to their enrolment at Ashesi, perpetrated by people outside the Ashesi community. Three students reported having experienced rape "}, {"From": "Daniel Nii Tettey Botchway <daniel.botchway@ashesi.edu.gh>", "Subject": "Request for MathLab", "Message": "Hello Support, Heather one of the new faculty hire, wants Mathlab install on the computer she will have and also on the school computers for students to use.

Tickets will be sold at the door at GHc40 each. Here is the some info on what it's all about:  There is no escaping art.  It surrounds us: in everything from the fabrics we wear to the labels adorning what we drink.  Black people have long created and revered art. Yet, from music to visual arts to product design, the gift to create art is one of the least valued in Africa and throughout her diaspora. As a result, our people have rarely successfully built wealth that we could hand down from generation to generation by pursuing our art.  Hidden in a walkthrough maze with new experiences at every turn, One Night Stand will be a uniquely experiential celebration of black art in its many forms.  Attendees will have multidimensional experiences of the art on display and dive into sonic interpretations that bring each piece alive through combinations of sight and sound.  How do we invest in, develop and spread our art across a world that has always been eager to dance to our music or take inspiration from our fashion? How do we invest in sustainable creative industries that serve our own interests? These are the questions One Night Stand hopes to articulate and engage with.  The exhibition will be followed by a in-depth conversation on the experiences of the artwork, the future of Ghana\u2019s creative scene and the way forward in creating generational wealth for our collective benefit.

Mr. Owusu has generously offered to engage us extensively on this topic, and has also has given us carte blanche to ask him anything about his journey in leading the oil discovery: his gains, his struggles, dealing with the government, dealing with regulation, succeeding and losing as well.  On a personal note, I\u2019ve been intrigued about how Ghana and its citizens, in particular, can make the best of our oil discovery and hope to gain some insight from Mr. Owusu's experience. Join the Ashesi Economic Lecture Series at the Norton Motulsky Hall B, at 2.40pm to learn more about the oil industry, entrepreneurial opportunities therein and Mr. Owusu\u2019s impact.

Those white boards are wide enough to allow projection, whilst still permiting lecturers to write around the projection. A similar solution can be used in the older lecture halls like 218. The only concern for the older lecture halls would be the controls(switches) for the drop down projector screens, but those can be done away with, since the boards themselves can be used as the screens, hence doing away with the need for dedicated drop down projector screens. I think using a wider white board that stretches from the very edge of the left door, to the very edge of the right door, as shown in the diagram below, would be much better for teaching and learning.

[blog] This really works! Solar Lights for Berekuso Clinic - Years ago Ashesi students fundraised and installed a solar gen-set from Burro.  It had stopped working, so this team repaired the gen-set and installed a light system for the labor and delivery room for the village clinic.  [blog] Before, nighttime babies were delivered by cellphone torch. Cassava Miller for Ayim - this was an ambitious student project to design/build a mechanical human powered cassava grinder to replace the graters what are currently used.  [blog]  A significant amount of community involvement was incorporated in this project and their prototype is impressive.  There are several more interesting projects to read about on www.berekuso.com   Leadership IVe is a specialized final leadership course for engineering students that runs all year long.  In the first term, students interview a community to determine its needs, and then design an engineering solution to address those needs.   This term the students built their projects and worked with the community to refine them. Today present their project and what they learned in the process."}, {"From": "Kwabena Buamono Abogye-Otchere ", "Subject": "Data structures and algorithms assignment", "Message": "I hope this email finds you well.

Yet as part of Ashesi University\u2019s growth and establishment as a nationally chartered and accredited learning organization, the deanship is a necessary leadership tier. After months of an unsuccessful search externally to fill the vacant and pending vacant positions, it has become apparent that our very able Heads of Departments have inherently extended their roles to effectively cover some of the dean-level responsibilities. The Academic Council, therefore approved, at a meeting on Wednesday, October 31st the promotion appointments of the following faculty members, effective immediately: Dr. Nathan Amanquah, to continue to serve a second year as Acting Dean of Engineering and Computer Science.  The position is a two-year term, and at the end of the second year of service, Dr. Amanquah will rotate off and Dr. Ayorkor G. Korsah, will serve as Acting Dean for a two-year term.  Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science will comprise\u2022Department of Engineering. The Department of Engineering oversees Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Electrical & Electronic Engineering.\u2022Department of Computer Science and Information Systems (CSIS). CSIS has primary responsibility for overseeing and advising both Computer Science and Management Information Systems students.
